## About this example site

This site uses [Netlify's On-demand builders](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/04/14/faster-builds-for-large-sites-on-netlify-with-on-demand-builders-now-in-early-access/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=github&utm_campaign=devex-ph&utm_content=devex-examples) to dynamically generate a page for any requested valid CSS color in hex, RGB, or named formats.

On-demand builders generate a page the first time it is requested and then adds it to the most recent deployment for immediate serving for each subsequent request. This is an implementation of the Distributed Persistent Rendering (DPR) model.
